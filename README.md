# AMOLED-Cord
A theme that's nice on your eyes.. lights out baby! This theme is some-what based off of the AMOLED theme that is on Android, but isn't as dark. (This theme is obviously meant for Dark Mode only)

## Issue Reporting
Since this is pretty much my first theme that completely colors and changes Discord, there will be issues with it, so don't expect it to be done flawlessly. If you notice any coloring issues (such as something being unthemed), please report it on the [Theme Source](https://github.com/LuckFire/theme-source) repo, as this theme relys on it as a coloring source. If you notice any unrelated issues, report it on this repo.
